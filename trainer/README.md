# Setup

In order for the argoCD application to be installed, head over to the k8s-infra repo where you set up the infrastructure for this workshop, and run the task `install-argo`.
    
``` bash
task argo:install-argo 
```

That should make everything ready for the workshop.
The argoCD UI can be accessed at the following URL: https://argocd.prefix.eficode.academy
